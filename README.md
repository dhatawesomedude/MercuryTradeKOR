Dear Konstantin,

I am a fellow developer in South Korea, who loves playing POE, with assistance of your handy and wellmade program MurcuryTrade.

The tool you developed has grown famous in Korean POE community too, and a lot of people are/were using it.
But recently, POE devs officially launched Korean client, which pretty much disabled most of the English client-based tools' features, including yours.

For the comfort of Korean players, I modified your program and made it possible for it to function properly in the Korean client.

I've read the MIT License, and decided it would not be a problem to distribute the modified version to the community.

Yet I thought it would be somewhat rude not to inform you, the original developer about this.
There is not, and there never will be a commercial use of this modified version of MurcuryTrade.

It is distributed completely free, without any commercial advertisement or any method of revenue.
Its only purpose is to comfort the Korean users, and I will make sure to state the original path and creator.

I am planning to translate the whole program into Korean, and I will inform you about the progress up to date.

If there is any sort of problem, or even if you feel uncomfortable about the fact that I modified your program without your consent, I will immediately cease the distribution. 

Thanks, and have a nice day.
